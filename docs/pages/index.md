#### What is GraphQL?
*GraphQL* is a data query language and runtime designed to request and deliver data in a performant way.

Advantages of using *GraphQL*:
* Only **one API endpoint**. One roundtrip for fetch everything you need.
* No data overfetching or underfetching.
* Autogenerated Graphical UI and docs based in your schema.
